# Peak Detection Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains Python scripts implementing five peak detection algorithms. The algorithms are designed to identify peaks in time series, and it has been adapted from the original research described in [Girish Palshikar's paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228853276_Simple_Algorithms_for_Peak_Detection_in_Time-Series).
